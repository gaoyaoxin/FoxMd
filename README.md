Do you want to just write and not be distracted? Well that's where this editor might come in handy.
 
I've looked at a bunch of other editors, and while they all had some cool features none of them had all that I wanted,
and so here we are with yet another editor. 

Features, everyone loves features:

* Fade out paragraphs that you've not writing in
* Make your cursor stick to the center, lower or upper half of the screen (because moving your eyes is so hard!)
* It's a full screen app (when run as atom shell as described below)
* All controls fade out so that all you see is the editing area
* Statistics that update as your type
* Markdown syntax support (maybe, not so sure about that one... seems like a lot of work)
* Choose your own styles... or maybe not, we'll see about that
* and... you know an editor... where you can write stuff

# Installation
